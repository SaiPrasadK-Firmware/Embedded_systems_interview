# Embedded Systems Interview Questions & Answers

Welcome to my collection of embedded systems and C programming interview questions!  
I'm actively working through each question, solving them one by one as part of my interview preparation. All answers are written and tested by me, and I'll continue adding solutions over time.

## How to Use This Repo
